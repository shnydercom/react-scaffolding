# react-scaffolding

# IDEA
- basic CRUD
- one relationship
- a table to show the properties

# Discussions
- GraphQL, because I'm familiar with it
- neo4jGraphQL, because then we don't have to worry about the backend at first
- I'm not familiar with nestjs, SOLID snippets: https://medium.com/@glan.harith0301/utilizing-nest-js-best-practices-applying-oop-and-solid-principles-0931bcda749c


# CLI commands
